<p class="p1">Data-based - Greg J. Smith</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">From computationally arranging the names of the deceased at the National September 11 Memorial to mapping the viral spread of links to New York Times articles on Twitter, Canadian software artist Jer Thorp has changed the way we think about data. Now a co-founder of the interdisciplinary 'supergroup' the Office for Creative Research, Thorp is posed to reinvent how we not only represent, but engage quantitative information.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">—It is the third week of December 2011 and within the brightly lit confines of a cramped studio, Natalie Beer carefully handles her asymmetrical, custom-knit scarf while outlining the organizational logic driving her neckwear. Natalies scarf is no mere accessory: under the tutelage of Jer Thorp, knitting is the medium through which shes chosen to explore seven years of sales data from the t~e worlds handmade marketplace platform Etsy. Beyond wearable web analytics, other projects demonstrated include a mockup of a monument for fatally injured cyclists, a tearaway mood diary, and an ornate series of visualizations tracking the increasing density of satellites orbiting Earth over the last six decades. Welcome to the final reviews of H79.2988 Data Representation, an elective course offered within the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at New York Citys Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Thorp's broad-minded approach to information design informs his course, and he challenges students to think about data as something that can not only be rendered onscreen but sculpted, crafted, or fabricated. Over the last several years, the scruffy,bespectacled, and irrepressibly curious Canadian software. artist has authored and collaborated on a series of innovative visualization projects that have earned him global recognition and allowed him to be both brave and selective with his subsequent undertakings. At the beginning of 2013, Thorp seized on this momentum and formalized an ongoing working relationship with statistician Mark Hansen and media artist Ben Rubin to launch the Office for Creative Research (OCR), "a mix between an R&amp;D group, a think tank and an artist collective.”</p>
<p class="p1">The morning after the studio crits, we find ourselves a few blocks east of Thorp's DUMBO studio, perched on stools at the Brooklyn Roasting Company. Thorp is in good spirits: his teaching obligations for the semester have just concluded and he's savouring his first tea of the day, opining on the current 'halcyon days' of databased practices. "If you think of it in terms of an innovation curve, there is always going to be a burst of experimentation in the beginning, when people are trying to find footholds in whatever kind of solution terrain is available.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The challenges of navigating this metaphorical rugged landscape, and lack of established, stifling best practices, propel Thorp forward, as both a programmer and educator. Our conversation drifts through his teaching philosophy, his role as the unofficial 'lobbyist' for the Processing community, and some work he recently did for Popular Science. I find it a little unnerving that Thorp knows about every tenth patron that files through this cafe: as a coffee-in-hand chic designer departs he whispers, "Her work is amazing, she's won three national design awards." He then launches into an elaborate summary of his experience at ITP without skipJ-ing a beat.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Thorp is more than qualified to speak authoritatively about data-based practice. Several of his recent visualization projects have been received as groundbreaking 'instant classics' by information design aficionados. This is a discerning audience,one that is simultaneously ravenous for new approaches to representing quantitative information while also demanding novel interactions. One such initiative, Project Cascade, developed in the spring of 2011, prototyped an elegant 3D interface that mapped the conversational nature of the social web by tracking the way links to articles from the New York Times spread across Twitter. While the visualization is fabulous at representing the dense, ephemeral social constellations that populate the web, it is equally useful as a cipher for understanding the chain of events that saw Thorp-a Vancouverite-dig in and adopt New York City as his new home.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">In the summer of 2010, Mark Hansen (who was at the time affiliated with UCLA) approached The New York Times Company Research &amp; Development Lab to inquire if they would be willing to host his research sabbatical. This proposal w·as received enthusiastically and Hansen began several research initiatives, eventually deciding to explore how content from the New York Times disseminated across social space and how influence factored into knowledge sharing networks. Already on the radar of the R&amp;D department for some text analysis work he had done with the New York R&amp;D Lab Times APis-and in town for a residency at Columbia University's EdLab-Thorp was WaS an invited for an informal conversation with Hansen, Matt Boggie, Nick Bilton, and interview Michael Young. "I didn't think it was an interview of any kind, but I ended up getting a job," he explains. Thorp soon joined the lab on a half-time basis as its first Data Artist in Residence, and became a full-time NYC resident in the process. He lights up when asked to describe the collaboration that ensued. "It was the perfect example of how a project should work, with the exchange between Mark and I. His statistical getting a work would influence the visualization, which would influence the statistical work, and we ended up stepping up and up and up until we reached this system."</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The New York Times R&amp;D Lab is a curious place. In exploring it there are moments when you might mistake it for a cubicle farm, but then you round a corner and encounter a bathroom mirror display prototype intended to deliver breaking news to its owner while they brush their teeth. After my tour, Thorp marches me into a long hallway arrayed with wall-mounted flat screen monitors, fires up Project Cascade, and shows me some of the branching geometries of link sharing on Twitter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">My favourite of the demo videos released when the project launched depicts the spread of the viral2010 story "Fed-Up Flight Attendant Makes Sliding Exit." The story focused on Steven Slater, a disgruntled JetBiue employee who snapped and ended his career with a blistering PA-system diatribe, beverage cart booze raid, and dramatic deplaning trifecta at John F. Kennedy International Airport. A rendering of the visualization tracks the story from the moment it breaks through blip utterances, plotted on a radar-like social scope; the camera shifts position and glides downwards to reveal a 30 network diagram that lucidly illustrates the branching geometry and staccato rhythm of link sharing. The demo also transitions through histogram and a 'fingerprint' display, offering gestalt analytics as a concise counterpoint to the richly detailed social clusters foregrounded in other views.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Despite its immaculate detail, Thorp confides that Project Cascade was "only five percent of what it could be," and that the visualization "unlocked hundreds of questions" about the propagation of information and ultimately 'influence' on Twitter. The visualization has inspired thoughtful conversation about social media on forward-thinking publications like Nieman Journalism Lab, captured the imagination of epidemiologists, and zoomed far beyond the insight offered by hackneyed entrepreneurial influence analytics startups like Klout. Originally a Processing application, Project Cascade now runs in a web browser and the prototype has become a full-blown product, available as part of The New York Times R&amp;D Ventures program for commercial clients who are looking to glean insight about the trajectory of information as it speeds across Twitter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For Hansen and Thorp, Project Cascade was more than a wildly successful first collaboration; it became a solid chunk of the foundation underpinning OCR. Thorp radiates excitement when describing his new studio and it is clear that the business model has emerged from years of thinking. "We'll be looking at a mix of work that will range from gallery projects, public art installations, to more obscure R&amp;D type work for companies that meet our ethical criteria." Over email. Hansen is both precise and flattering in qualifying his creative dynamic with Thorp: "Jer has a <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1"><b>kind</b></span><span class="s2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>of fearlessness that I covet ... I've tried to get my students to think of data as a verb rather than a noun and Jer lives that idea to an extent that I hadn't thought possible."</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Born in Vancouver in 1973, programming was a source of i'1spiration during Thorp's early years. He jokes that his "1980s basement contained IBM punch cards and two floor looms" that respectively reflected his father's career in information management and his mother's master weaver status. Thorp fondly recalls his first computer, an IBM, as "a beast with a green monochrome screen that sounded like a lawnmower starting when you turned it on." He_ cites the 1986 replacement of that workstation with an Apple Macintosh as a turning point in his young life. While he had dabbled with BASIC on that first PC, the simplicity of another programming language, one that was bundled with Mac system software, inspired him to delve further into programming. "HyperCard was a really beautiful little thing. It was visual; you could drag and drop buttons and produce your own elements in. other programs and then bring in and add scripting elements." Thorp is dismissive of these fledgling experiments and grimaces while describing the only program he can remember, an "awful" lottery number generator. "I certainly didn't build anything that I'd want to show anybody,but I remember the excitement of those days, spending my summers in the basement, learning that programming wasn't that difficult of a thing to do."</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Despite these subterranean teenage adventures in code, Thorp had other plans about where he was going to put his energy in university. "As a skinny little nerd with glasses, everyone just sort of assumed that I was a computer kid, but I was convinced that wasn't the case." He enrolled at the University of British Columbia in 1993 with a primary focus on science and biology, but he also pursued photography and art. Several years later, Thorp found himself working at the Vancouver Aquarium-"a fantastic job that paid very poorly." Egged on by a former co-worker, he decided to apply for a job as a Flash developer at a local dot-com. The only problem: he didn't know the first thing about Flash. "I literally went home, Googled what Flash was, downloaded the trial version, and taught myself how to use it over a weE!fend," he says while grinning sheepishly. "I cobbled together a Flash-based resume and sent it to the company and got hired." This abrupt career change was a mixed blessing for Thorp. "It was great because I had a challenging job, and terrible because I had no idea what I was doing." But in hustling to develop his ActionScript skills outside of the nine-to-five grind, he found he was able to capitalize on his 'experience with HyperTalk (a programming language bundled with HyperCard). "Since the languages were fairly similar, the ideas were really similar, and as ActionScript became objectoriented it all made sense to me." It turns out the marketplace for Flash development made sense to Thorp as well, as the years that followed saw him develop a range of high-profile commercial projects for the web.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Immersed in the homestead ambiance of Brooklyn's Vinegar Hill House, and a drink and a half into the evening, Thorp shares details about the years preceding his move to NYC. I ask him if he felt his practice began to really crystallize when he moved away from commercial work and he rebuts sharply: "No, it was when I moved away from doing work Iwasn't interested in." Thorp identifies two extended residencies -both collaborations-with the Canadian media artist M. Simon Levin as being vital in changing his thinking about the potential scale and duration of projects. These were the Glocallmage Breeder, a toolkit for analyzing a large collection of user-contributed photographs and manipulating these assets with genetic algorithms, and Code.lab, a public art project that allowed tourists and citizens to play with the omnipresent mediated gaze that permeated public space during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The first project was hatched during a fourteen-month residency at the Surrey Art Gallery, and the latter over nine months at the Emily Carr University of Art + Design. "We spent almost every day for three years together working on publicly funded, participatory projects with fairly large budgets and fairly ambiguous scope.'' While working on the Code.lab project, Thorp found time to develop a number of quick proof-of-concept experiments in Processing drawing on social web and news-related A Pis. Just Landed and Good Morning! both used rudimentary searches of the public Twitter stream to sequence and geolocate stock social utterances Tweets containing "I just landed in .. .'' and "Good Morning!" became the basis of dynamic visualizations that revealed the hyperactive and syncopated rhythms of global mobility and connectivity. That same year, Thorp also did a considerable amount of work with the freshly-launched APis for the New York Times and The Guardian to reveal the year-to-year ideological and linguistic undercurrents that influence the churn of the news cycle. When I interviewed him about this news-related API work in the spring of 2009, he was quite adamant that these projects were exploratory first and foremost: "Specifically, I'm interested in using these data sources as substrates for more abstract visualizations-systems that don't so much embody the actual data as the patterns and trends that might exist hidden within them."</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">While the technical wizardry of his Processing experiments and Project Cascade received accolades within the computational design community, it was Thorp's contribution to the National September 11 Memorial that alerted a broader international audience to his practice. From late 2009 through the following spring, he worked with the NYC-based media design firm Local Projects to develop an algorithm to arrange the names of the 2,983 victims of the September 11th attacks for inscription on seventy-six bronze plates, fixed to the parapet walls, surrounding the memorial's twin pools. On being asked to contextualize his role in the design, Thorp pauses then offers a disclaimer. "It's a project that I'm relatively uncomfortable discussing.'' Given the scale and gravity of the much larger space it served, he remains concerned that the attention the algorithm received was overblown. "It was a lot of work and I put seven months of my life into it, but the architects spent a decade on it.''</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The story behind the name arrangement algorithm commission began in October 2009 when Thorp received an email from Local Projects principal designer Jake Barton. The Michael Arad-led consortium of architects working on the project had hit an impasse with their design for the memorial and Barton and his team needed a way to sort the daunting number of victim names based on 'meaningful adjacencies.' Thorp had recently worked with Vancouver's Tangible Interaction to hatch a design scheme to generate the Richmond Middle Arm Playscape using genetic algorithms, so he was a logical candidate to approach to discuss this complex task.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The 9/11 casualty list posed numerous challenges: while the deceased could be institutionally categorized-employees at World Trade Centre (WTC}-based companies like the investment bank Cantor ~itzgerald L.P. (who lost an astonishing 658 employees) and the insurer Marsh &amp; Mclennan Companies (295 dead); passengers of American Airlines Flights 11 (76) and 93 (33); first responders (-400); and victims of the 1993 WTC bombing (7)-there was an additional world of nuance that needed to be commemorated. The goal was for the grouping of names to move beyond clustering by professional affiliations to also consider friendship~, blood ties, and the powerful bonds forged through heroism and happenstance amidst the smoke and chaos of that infamous morning. Thorp remembers his skeptical response to Local Projects' invitation clearly. "I told Jake that I'd love to work on this, but I'm not sure if it is possible." It turns out this doubt was not ill-founded-two computer scientists had already retreated from the specifications outlined in the project brief.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Years before construction began, the 9/11 Memorial Foundation had been developing a database of more than 1,200 adjacency requests from the next of kin of the victims. Local Projects' task was twofold: take the knowledge in this database and use it to deliver optimal plaque panel layout options, and output 'drafts' to be further refined by human editors. There were numerous construction and implementation constraints affecting potential layout configurations:panel sizes varied (some were corner pieces) and while the letters of many names had to give the illusion of seamlessly flowing across adjacent panels, the tiny expansion joint between panels could only accommodate certain letterform combinations. A Processing application was developed to accommodate these rigid contextual, typographic,and assembly requirements that was able to satisfy more than 98% of the requested adjacencies. Next, a second application was developed to view, consider, and further refine the layouts and export SVG versions for fine-tuning in Adobe Illustrator. Thorp describes this human knowledge to algorithmic heavy lifting then back to human editor workflow as epitomizing "computer-assisted design," something he has long lauded. "At the end of the day, human judgement produced the final project but our algorithm and software tool was essential to that process."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To most practitioners working in and around the field of information design, the herculean task of sorting the names of those lost to 9/11 would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. What greater challenge could a designer or artist hope for than to impose some tiny measure of order to the aftermath of a cataclysmic series of events? Thorp demonstrates no such careerism when discussing the project, and " describes how working with those thousands of names was transformative; he shifted from the passive engagement of "somebody who-like everybody else in Canada-watched 9/11 on TV" to being emotionally invested in each one of those fates. "I know that if I hadn't worked on the memorial that I could have come to New York and seen it and I would have been solemn and quiet, and I would have felt the weight of it-but I wouldn't have ... " he trails off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">More than a year after my visit to New York to shadow Thorp, we schedule a Skype session to catch up. He has promised to reveal details about OCR, which will be announced in a few weeks. Once we connect I can see Thorp tucked away into one of the more remote corners of the New York Times R&amp;D Lab. He excitedly shares his "big news," that his position as Data Artist in Residence is drawing to a close. "The residency was supposed to b.e four months, and-a peer of mine said something nice that I really like-1 ended up doing it in dog years and was here for twenty-eight." Thorp reveals that from January 1st, 2013 onwards, OCR will be his full-time focus. The charged description of teaming up with Hansen and Rubin implies that the convergence of practices was inevitable. "We've been loosely collaborating for about three years and we felt it would be good to turn it into something with a bit more structure and have the ability to bring on some more people and work on bigger projects." We chat for a while longer and he concludes on a whimsical note. "We're really excited about putting this group together, we'll kind of be the A-Team of data." If you have a problem, if no one else can help ... With thoughts of the opening narration of the TV series in mind, we sign off.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">As would be expected, Thorp's new studio is buzzing with activity. The first 'official' OCR installation, The room would be good enough for the time she had to stay, was mounted at the Vancouver Art Gallery as part of Grand Hotel, an exhibition that ran last summer. Merging photography, surveillance footage, and data representing a million hotels from around the world with narratives from literary road trips, the piece reveals the hidden stories of banal-but-ubiquitous transient accommodations. Another recent project saw OCR contribute to the New York City-based Elevator Repair Service theatre troupe's production of Arguendo, and transform the voluminous mass of legal transcripts produced during a 1991 Supreme Court obscenity trial into a dizzying projected backdrop of legalese and rhetoric.The common thread that runs through this work is that data is treated as a medium, one that is to be explored, parsed, and leveraged as a means to ignite broader cultural conversations.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Perhaps OCR's nascent form is best foreshadowed by And That's The Way It Is, a public art installation permanently installed at Walter Cronkite Plaza at the University of Texas at Austin in the spring of 2012. While largely spearheaded by Rubin, Thorp and Hansen assisted in building a system that projected excerpts from the Cronkite transcript archives onto the gridded facade of Building A of the Jesse H. Jones Communication Center. In our Skype conversation, Thorp had remarked on OCR's desire to be a catalyst and "bring data into people's quotidian lives." Animating the front of a communications faculty with historic broadcast news excerpts (rendered in Courier) and breaking headlines (in Verdana), and challenging passers-by with making sense of this weave of atemporal narratives, seems like a provocative start. In recent years, Thorp has rallied against the myopic Silicon Valley drumbeating that has heralded data as 'the new oil,' yet another resource to be monetized and exploited. On further reflection, his off-the-cuff contextualization of And That's The Way It Is may well double as an OCR mission statement: "Now more than ever, people can choose what they see and that is the problem with our age of so-called 'filter bubbles.' By putting things in public space, you kind of shatter that condition.''--</p>
